# My Learning Repository for Git & GitHub

## Project Goal
This repository serves as my personal sandbox for mastering the essential tools for software development: the Git version control system and the GitHub platform. The primary goal is not to write complex code, but to build a solid foundation in using these instruments professionally.

This `README.md` file itself is my first practical exercise in using Markdown for documentation.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Updated my headline and summary to reflect my goals.
  - Rewrote my work experience to highlight relevant engineering skills.
  - Curated my skills list to prioritize Embedded-related technologies.

### 2. GitHub Account Setup
- **Goal:** To create a space for my future portfolio.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Registered a professional account.
  - Created this first repository to understand the core concepts.

### 3. Local Development Environment Setup
- **Goal:** To prepare my local machine for professional development workflow.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - **Installed Git:** The core version control system.
